In the next lecture, Stephen will be going over how to install Create React App globally and generate the application. This method of generating a React project is no longer recommended.

Instead of this:

npm install -g create-react-app

create-react-app client

We need to run this command:

npx create-react-app client

Important Reminder:

Once you have generated the React app you will need to delete the local git repository that Create React App may have automatically initialized.

Inside the newly created client directory, run rm -r .git

If you miss this step, the client folder will be considered a submodule and pushed as an empty folder to GitHub.

Documentation:

https://create-react-app.dev/docs/getting-started#npx

If you've previously installed create-react-app globally via npm install -g create-react-app, we recommend you uninstall the package using npm uninstall -g create-react-app to ensure that npx always uses the latest version.
