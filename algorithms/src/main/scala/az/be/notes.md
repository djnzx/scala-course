- The task is:
- to generate a random string from characters [A-Z,a-z]with the length = 30;
- extract all the vowels, consonants, upper and lowercase into different strings
- "Hello, my dear friend, please keep learning, I'll guarantee you'll reach the moment you understand everything"
  the task is:
   - to remove any letters except 'A'..'Z' and 'a'..'z'
   - to convert residual letters to lower-case
   - to calculate how many times each letter occurs in the string
   - to calculate on which position particular letter occurs
   - pint out the final result in following way: [<'a' : 3 : [1,2,5]>, <'f' : 4 : [7,8,11,12]> ...]

- Rectangles.
  you've been given a random number of rectangles
  all of them located horizontally
  so, each rectangle represented by two points
  a(x1,y1) and b(x2,y2)
  they can intersect between each other
  they can be nested into each other
  they can be separated between each other
  Task:
  to calculate TOTAL area occupied by rectangles
  without intersection duplications.
